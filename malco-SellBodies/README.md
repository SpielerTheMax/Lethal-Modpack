This is just my [Cleaning Company mod](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/malco/CleaningCompany/) but only the code for selling enemies dead bodies.

### V 1.1.0:
- fixed the old non sellable body remaining on client.
- Added eyeless dog, bracken, and baboon hawk.
- Added config options to disable body drops for specific mobs.

In the config you can change the amount of credits the bodies are worth, the weight of the bodies, and what mobs can or can't be sold.

This mod will be maintained but not added to. You're more than welcome to make a pull request on the github if you'd like to see additions.
